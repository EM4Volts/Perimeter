## Perimeter, a Blender addon for QOL Titanfall 2 modding



code is a mess rn, will sort it out sometimes in the future.


DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE RELEASE ZIPS, DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE FROM ABOVE
## Setup


In Blender install Blender Source Tools addon, if you dont have it this wont work https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Blender_Source_Tools


Download the addon as a zip using the cool green button up there.

Install the addon in blender, enable it, and in its settings select your titanfall 2 folder, press the "setup studiomdl" button and select either your source film maker, portal 2(with sdk)or alien swarm (with sdk) install folders.

Somewhere on your pc make a folder and put repak.exe https://github.com/r-ex/RePak in there
put texconv.exe https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases/download/jun2023/texconv.exe
and mdlshit.exe https://github.com/headassbtw/mdlshit/releases/download/2.3.2/mdlshit_windows_x64.zip
in there too, select them in the addons preferences

# how to use:

most of the new rpak panel should be selfexplainatory

its intended to be used for the final export part, as its way of handling some things are specific, for help consult the images below or contact me on discord ```4v_```

will add proper guide for all stuff in the future
